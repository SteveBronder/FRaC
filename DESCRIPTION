Description: FRaC is a general approach to the anomaly detection problem that
    is, the task of identifying instances that come from a different class or
    distribution than the majority (unsupervised anomaly detection) or a set of
    verified "normal" data (semi-supervised anomaly detection).The key to
    making this approach work is to precisely quantify the amount of evidence
    provided by each observation. To this end, FRaC developes a novel,
    information-theoretic anomaly measure that combines the contributions of
    all feature models.
