To this end, FRaC developes a novel, information-theoretic anomaly measure that combines the contributions of all feature models.\n}\n\\details{\n\\tabular{ll}{\nPackage: \\tab FRaC\\cr\nType: \\tab Package\\cr\nVersion: \\tab 0.0.1\\cr\nDate: \\tab 2015-05-01\\cr\nLicense: \\tab GPL 3.0\\cr\n}\n}\n\\author{\nWho wrote it\n\nMaintainer: Who to complain to <yourfault@somewhere.net>\n~~ The author and/or maintainer of the package ~~\n}\n\\references{\nK.
